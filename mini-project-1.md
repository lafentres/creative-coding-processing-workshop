# Mini-project #1
It's time for your first sketch, incorporating the things you've learned about Processing so far! For this project, you should try to draw a simple picture. We'll spend about 20 minutes on this. 

Some ideas for things to draw are:
1. Self-portrait
1. Portrait of someone else in the workshop
1. An item in your bag or in this room
1. A made up creature
1. Robot
1. Your favorite animal
1. Recreate a famous painting, photo, sculpture, etc

Don't worry about capturing a ton of details or getting things perfect. The point is to practice what you've learned and have fun creating something simple.
