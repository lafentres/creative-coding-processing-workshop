# Final Project

Now it is time to take what you've learned and come up with your own sketch idea. 
Feel free to build on your previous projects or start something completely new. 
You could also use this time to explore topics we haven't had time to cover. 
[Processing.org has a lot of good tutorials](https://processing.org/tutorials). 

Some other resources:
[LearnProcessing](http://learningprocessing.com/).
[HappyCoding](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/)

Feel free to look through any of the books I've brought as well.
