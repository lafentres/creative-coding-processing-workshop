# Mini-project #2

This mini-project builds on your first mini-project. Using the drawing you created in your first mini-project, try to make your sketch interactive using your keyboard or mouse.

Some ideas:
1. Make all the color shift based on mouse position
1. Change color, replace shapes, or move drawing when keys are pressed
1. Make your drawing follow the mouse

To make this easier, you may find it useful to move the main components of your drawing into their own function that takes variables to determine the drawings overall position. 

Feel free to start a new project that is interactive with the keyboard and/or mouse if you'd prefer to not use your previous project.
